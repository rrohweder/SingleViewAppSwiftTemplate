/*
    There has not been a unit that added functionality to the appDelegate yet,
    but I am thinking that pre-loading data like I am doing below would be
    done there.  I considered doing the load at the point of the first request
    for an entrant record (a call to populateFormWithRandomPerson()) or, later
    a call to canAccess(), but I would not design that way for a production app,
    since any of the problems that might cause a fail to pull the data at all
    should occur early.

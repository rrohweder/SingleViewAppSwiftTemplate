// Arguments used to create an object (such a Worker) should be checked before calling the object init
// These functions can be used by the caller to do that:

class Hourly: Worker {
    // properties needed for this exercise are handled in the Worker superclass.
    // one could picture how the swipe into an area might be used to 
    // record hours worked in an area, for instance, in which case
    // there could be other properties specific to this WorkerType.
}

class Manager: Worker {
    // properties needed for this exercise are handled in the Worker superclass
    // one could picture how the swipe into an area might be used to record
    // hours in an area (to support a Manager Area Coverage Report), for instance, 
    // in which case there could be other properties specific to this WorkerType.
